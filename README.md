# react-blog
A blog created using django and react.

This blog's UI is very bare boned and basic. The point of this blog was to connect a react app with a django backend.

The frontend "UI" is done in bootstrap.

I use axios to connect backend to frontend.
Within the backend I use django rest framework.
